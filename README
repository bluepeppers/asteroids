Asteroids Game
==============

Implementing lab 3 of chapter 12 of Head First C.

Implementation
==============

Asteroid
--------

Asteroid edges are represented as an array of vectors. The sum of those vectors must be 0.
All asteroids have 12 edges; when an asteroid is split, the edge that splits must be made up
of 6 vectors.

Player
------

The player is represented by two vectors; a position vector and a direction vector.

Particles
---------

Purely graphical particles are managed by an opaque particle manager. The data defining the particles are:

- Lifetime of particle (frames, given 60 frames per second
- Velocity vector of particle (pixels per frame)
- Start position vector of particle
- Frame created
- Color
- Width

Bullets
-------

Similarly to Particles, Bullets are defined as 

- Velocity (Potentially const?)
- Current position

Collision Detection
-------------------

Potential collisions:

- Ship & Asteroid
- Asteroid & Bullet
- Asteroid & Asteroid

Investigate algorithms to detect collisions between arbitrary polygons and points.
